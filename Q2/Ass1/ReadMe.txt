///////// Storing 20 Images in an Array /////////

The code in file 'Img20NP' fetches 20 images from the folder 'photos'.
It converts each image into data and then converts it into an array form separately.
Then it resizes that data and makes a new file of shape 200x200x3 and stores in the folder 'cars'
It converts these 20 images into new arrays forms individually.
Then these arrays of 3 dimensions are arranged in such a way to make a 4 dimension array.

1). Img20NP	(Pyhton Code)
2). photos	(images to be converted)
3). cars	(imgaes to be stored after being converted)
